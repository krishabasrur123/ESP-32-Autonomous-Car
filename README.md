The ESP-32 car is an integral part of a pioneering initiative in autonomous vehicle technology. Designed to operate using ESP-32 microcontrollers, 
this vehicle leverages advanced computer vision capabilities for object recognition and tracking. Key technologies employed include YOLO (You Only Look Once) 
for real-time object identification and OpenCV for continuous camera monitoring via an IP address. These technologies enable the car to autonomously detect and track humans, facilitating intelligent navigation and interaction.

This project is pivotal in advancing the field of autonomous vehicles, aiming to enhance safety, efficiency, and automation in transportation systems. By integrating cutting-edge software frameworks like YOLO and OpenCV, the ESP-32 car demonstrates practical applications of machine learning and computer vision in real-world scenarios. This repository serves as a testament to ongoing research and development efforts towards achieving fully autonomous mobility solutions.
